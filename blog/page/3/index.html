  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are hiring mistakes you can make even knowing you&#8217;re making a mistake.
The problem is that sometimes you have this deadline, or you&#8217;ve been searching for the perfect hire for months, and you lower your standards.
Hey, maybe that guy who arrived 20 minutes late to the interview wasn&#8217;t that bad after all&#8230;</p>

<p>Or wasn&#8217;t he?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always short sighted, there&#8217;s a saying in spanish &#8220;pan para hoy y hambre para ma√±ana&#8221;, something like &#8220;feast today, famine tomorrow&#8221;. It will come back to bite you.</p>

<p>No matter what, here are 5 things that you shall never do.</p>

<h2>1 You shall not hire in a hurry</h2>

<p>Just the fact that you need someone in a hurry is a red flag. Hiring someone in that situation is going from bad to worse.
In the short term you may put out the fire, but in the long run you&#8217;ve compromised your foundations.</p>

<p>If you really,really, <strong>really</strong> need a puppet to fill a chair tomorrow, hire a freelancer and dismiss it when the project&#8217;s over.
Building a team is like building a family, you don&#8217;t invite the first monkey coming out the door to be your cousin when you need someone to hug you.</p>

<h2>2 You shall not hire someone you don&#8217;t respect</h2>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean you can only hire your heroes, respect is about recognition of abilities or achievements.
You can respect someone smarts, you can respect what someone has built, or you can be in awe of someone&#8217;s interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_art_of_recr.html">B players hiring C players</a>. I&#8217;m talking about the case you dismissed the position you&#8217;re hiring for, and started thinking a &#8220;good enough&#8221; was good enough.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Aim for someone who can blow the position out of the water, hiring someone who can barely do the job says you are ok with mediocrity in your team.</p>

<p>If you have some task that good enough will do, outsource it.</p>

<h2>3 You shall never hire a prick</h2>

<p>There will come the time when you interview this someone who&#8217;s a freaking beast, smart, fast, experienced, but he&#8217;s a jerk.</p>

<p>No hire.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this company here in Uruguay who used to have two brilliant jerks in their own apartment to keep them from fucking up the rest of the team.
Unless this kind of jerk isolation works for you, no hire, you&#8217;re building a team you know?</p>

<h2>4 You shall never hire by price</h2>

<p>Would you buy a plane ticket from an airline who&#8217;s not doing their maintenance, the pilot started flying yesterday, and had 10 incidents the last month,
just because the tickets are half the price?</p>

<p>Why is it that people put their companies in the hand of incompetents just because they&#8217;re cheap?
Cheap is always more exensive in the long run, it&#8217;s not only about hiring <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/01/10/some-programmers-really-are-10x-more-productive/">10x developers</a>,
lousy developers create more bugs, write unmantainable code and will make your customers mad because they can&#8217;t handle a phone call like a human being.</p>

<p>Beware, more expensive doesn&#8217;t always equal better, there are some clever incompetents who are fond of asking more money when the market&#8217;s hot.
Never hire by price means salary is not your main deciding factor.</p>

<h2>5 You shall never ever hire on behalf of others</h2>

<p>If your company has more than 10 employees, you are not hiring by yourself.
You think you&#8217;re so smart you know what&#8217;s good for your company, above and beyond? It doesn&#8217;t matter, each person gets hired by her manager and her future team.</p>

<p>This is what you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>You set the standard</li>
<li>You set the hiring process</li>
<li>You get veto power at the end</li>
<li>That&#8217;s it</li>
</ul>


<p>Let people do their own fuck ups and take responsibility for it, that&#8217;s how you grow better leaders</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Uruguay it&#8217;s not common for software companies to fire people, on one side the employment law makes it almost impossible to fire someone, even if <a href="http://www.diarioelpueblo.com.uy/generales/gremio-de-conaprole-aclara-varias-interrogantes-en-relacion-al-conflicto-que-mantiene.html">they&#8217;ve robbed you</a> and it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ultimasnoticias.com.uy/hemeroteca/030610/prints/act09.html">video taped</a>.
On the other, there are so many companies evading taxes they&#8217;re held hostage of their own misdaemenor.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a shame, firing someone that&#8217;s not pulling his own weight is almost as important as hiring the right people, is how you build your team; is how you choose who you are.</p>

<p>Letting someone go is a traumatic process for everyone involved, and being something uncommon, almost no one has experiences to share.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve fired a few people over the years, I thought I should share a few things I&#8217;ve learned.</p>

<h2>The problem won&#8217;t disappear by itself</h2>

<p>First things first, a company is not a country club, it&#8217;s more like a pro sport team. You play to win, the best players are on the field, if someone doesn&#8217;t fit, he goes home.</p>

<p>When someone in the team is not playing his part, everybody knows it, and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to hide it.
The offender knows it, your team know it, you know it, and the people on the grades know it.</p>

<p>If you have someone on your team that&#8217;s not performing and you&#8217;re doing nothing about it, you&#8217;re a buffoon, and everybody thinks you don&#8217;t have what it takes to run the show.</p>

<h2>Who&#8217;s guilty? You&#8217;re guilty </h2>

<p>Common reasons someone doesn&#8217;t perform as expected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t have the skills to do the job</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t adapt to the rest of the team</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t adapt to the dynamic of the company</li>
<li>Uncomfortable with the tasks at hand</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of the time, it&#8217;s not the person&#8217;s fault, it&#8217;s your fault to hire them wrong, but anyway you&#8217;re demanding something you should have validated you&#8217;re unable to demand from that person. Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of yourself?</p>

<p>Ask yourself, did I checked this person was qualified for the job and a fit for the team and company culture?</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> This is why you want people to be hired by the ones <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hiring-Knowledge-Workers-Techies-Nerds/dp/0932633595">working with them</a>, not by some human resources suit 3 floors above.</p>

<h2>Why you need to fire them</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you don&#8217;t, it undermines team morale</li>
</ul>


<p>If you work in a company where someone is not pulling his own weight and everything is fine, would you be motivated to do your best work?
Keeping a healthy team is <em>your</em> responsibility.</p>

<ul>
<li>Work doesn&#8217;t get done</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s no acceptable reason for having someone do a 50% work, it&#8217;s your job to find someone giving 100% on the position</p>

<ul>
<li>Lowered standards</li>
</ul>


<p>If you accept a job at half the quality from a person without the skills, hardly anyone will believe that quality work is crucial for success.</p>

<ul>
<li>Opportunities by the thousand</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/singingpig.jpg" width="150" height="250" title="'Dismissal communication approaches'" >
A job is not a lifelong incarceration and evaluations are never absolutes. Someone who doesn&#8217;t fit in a team can shine in others.
Never try to hard to make a pig sing, it wastes your time and it annoys the pig.</p>

<h2>What is your responsibility</h2>

<p>Being unemployed is a stressful situation, so sending someone home isn&#8217;t something you do on a rage day you&#8217;re mad about traffic congestion.</p>

<p>So&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>You talk</li>
</ul>


<p>Being crystal clear in your communications is the most undervalued skill in software development. People has a life. People have problems. Never thought about it huh?</p>

<p>Personal issues may impact work performance and you should be supportive. It&#8217;s also reasonable to think the company may have a bad time someday and
your team won&#8217;t jump ship. So you don&#8217;t let people down, period.</p>

<p>Beware, this is not about blind loyalty. I&#8217;ve met people with a different problem every single week, and some companies are definitely a sinking ship.</p>

<ul>
<li>You do gymnastics</li>
</ul>


<p>I have my fair share of bad hires, and I&#8217;ve paid for them with a lot of personal time. The usual time is the one you spend helping someone adapt or acquire missing skills.
It doesn&#8217;t always work, but it&#8217;s your job to try.</p>

<p>How long you do gymnastics is inversely proportional to the level of seniority of the subject; I&#8217;ve done a year and a half, and I&#8217;ve done two weeks.</p>

<h2>Making the call</h2>

<p>If talking doesn&#8217;t help, and gymnastics ain&#8217;t losing any fat; best for both is to break up.</p>

<p>As in any relationship, some people like to create uncomfortable situations in order to force the other be the one doing the break up.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be you.</p>

<p>On one side, you&#8217;re a chicken shit, on the other, it contaminates your opportunity to stand by something, letting someone go is also the time when people see what you think is important, what you think is critical, and what you think is unacceptable.
So, have your company clean, and make the call.</p>

<p>Just be clear and avoid absolutes, &#8220;you are no good&#8221; is almost never the case. &#8220;We aren&#8217;t a good fit&#8221; is almost always certain.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>When communicating the leave, I prefer sending an email to the team, it takes the drama out of the situation.
If you&#8217;ve done your homework this should be expected, and most of the time your team will be grateful.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/firednotification.jpg" width="300" height="400" title="'Dismissal communication approaches'" ></p>

<p>Avoid by any means justifying yourself on the decision. Trashing a person that&#8217;s not with you anymore to justify your call brings bad karma.</p>

<p>As the one in charge you&#8217;re not the one to be presented in a good light, do the shitty job, take the blame, and shut the fuck up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m almost always mad when I think about the country <a href="http://www.emol.com/noticias/economia/2012/06/18/546251/uruguay-espera-socio-privado-tras-salida-de-inversionistas-argentinos-de-aerolinea-pluna.html">being led by improvisers</a> without the basic skills to run a hot-dog stand. Prioritizing <em>politics</em> over technical knowledge should have ended when <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-philosophy/">Natural Philosophy</a> came to town.</p>

<p>The rigurosity provided by the scientific method has uncovered a lot of <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/controversy/">charlatans</a></p>

<p>But it does exist a phenomena that I call <em>The curse of the technocrat</em> that&#8217;s rampant in the software world, it happens when the cursed technocrat starts thinking the most important thing is her technology.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite sure it&#8217;s part of an identity crisis, when you&#8217;ve been so long sharpening your saw, becoming good at something deeply technical by nature, the survival instincts of feeling good about yourself will make you think your shit is important <em>by itself</em>.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>The most important thing at a particular moment, is the problem you have to solve, technique per-se has no meaning.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/blog/brokenchair.png" width="280" height="380" title="Chair designed by a cursed technocrat" alt="Chair designed by a cursed technocrat">
It&#8217;s like having a carpenter who&#8217;s happy about using a saw but knows nothing about people using his chairs.
Or a violinist with a great technique playing notes nobody wants to listen to.</p>

<p>As ridiculous as it seems, the software world is plagued by this cursed technocrats, with great technique, but don&#8217;t giving a fuck about customers <strong>having a better time</strong>.</p>

<p>These are my self assesment questions to detect any trace of the curse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can my grandma understand what problem I solved today, and for whom?</li>
<li>Is this doing life easier for somebody?</li>
<li>Will this make something cheaper for somebody?</li>
<li>Would someone pay to have this problem solved?</li>
<li>Is this a problem worth solving?</li>
<li>Have I spent more days paying technical debt than creating value?</li>
</ul>


<p>Doing things for self gratification is great, but pay attention if you should have been an engineer, you may be under the curse of the technocrat.</p>

<p>An antidote? make yourself accountable on your results, not on your techniques. Good technique develops if you aim high enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I saw an old Quora post asking <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-hard-concepts-to-understand-when-learning-how-to-program">what&#8217;s the hardest concept to understand</a> when learning how to program.</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<blockquote><p>Programming is hard, because reality is hard</p><footer><strong>@guilespi</strong> <cite>Reflexiones De Resaca</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>My answer:</p>

<hr />

<p>Some concepts are better explained by another student who has just grasped a concept than by a teacher who finds almost obvious all of the stuff.</p>

<p>So my list of difficult concepts to learn, is made of the many things most people do wrong, even with many years of experience.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Edge cases
Almost everybody can get the happy-path-version of an algorithm working with a little bit of work.
Not everybody can get the permutation of possibilities and edge cases right.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing code
Almost everybody can get an unmaintainable sheet of poorly designed code, spit some coherent output.
Not everybody can even understand when they&#8217;re looking at a huge mess, why is it that it&#8217;s a mess</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid repetition
This complexity arises from the need to have a <em>sometimes</em> huge system on your head at the same time.
Designing small libraries and doing a bottom-up design helps, but there will come the time when you need to have this huge monstrosity in your head at once, and you&#8217;ll fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrency
While there are many strategies to deal with many things happening at once with your reality, having a lot of moving parts is hard. As it&#8217;s hard having a system with thousands of small pieces talking to each other.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Many of this situations are just particular cases derived from the Brooks paper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">There&#8217;s no silver bullet</a>, you cannot evade reality essential complexity by doing tricks aimed at the accidental complexity of programming.</p>

<p>Programming is hard, because reality is hard.</p>
